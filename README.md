# Git Lesson

This lesson covers the basics of git for version control

This lesson is for the first day of the MSSE Bootcamp (CHEM 280)

To make a commit ("version") of your files, follow this procedure:

1. Make changes to your project that you would like to keep.
2. When you have your changes, tell `git` you are ready to create a checkpoint of the file using `git add FILENAME` command. 
3. Create a checkpoint of your file using `git commit -m MESSAGE ABOUT WHAT YOU DID`. git switch 

## Adding Features

Features should be developed on branches 
To create and switch to a branch:

`git switch -c BRANCH_NAME`

To switch to an existing branch, use:

`git switch BRANCH_NAME`
